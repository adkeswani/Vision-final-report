Each group is required to submit a final report (maximum 10 pages in IEEE 2-column format) before 5 PM Friday Oct 21st (last day of session)- watch out for submission instructions on the class webpage. The report should contain the following:

name and student ID of group members
title and definition of project goals
    - simple

relevant literature survey, with references at the end (may be an extension of interim report)
    - Describe the papers we looked at for the transformation
    - And the paper for optical flow
    - Discuss in general what people did in these other papers

problem decomposition: the tasks or subgoals involved
    - Matching
    - Transformation

Scope of project, including detailed specification
    - Numbers like number of frames per second to match
    - Must generate the forwards, sideways and theta of the robot
    - Facts like we have to approach the same level of accuracy as the 
    - This project must do this

design, algorithms used and implementation issues
    - Python -> C++
    - DIscuss our matching algo
    - Discuss out transformation algo

justification for design decisions, testing and results
    - Do we justify why we used our matching algo rather than SIFT/SURF here?
    - The mean and standard deviation we found for standing still
    - How fast it was?

conclusions and suggestions for future extensions
    - The points that we were looking at were too noisy
    - And as a result we couldn't get the correct odometry
    - We have plenty of stuff for future extensions

contribution of individual group members and subdivison of tasks.
    - Easy
